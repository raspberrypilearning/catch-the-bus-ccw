If you are following the [Introduction to Scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/scratch-intro) pathway, you can move on to the [Find the bug](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/find-the-bug) project. In this project, you will make a game in which you have to find the bug that is hiding on each level.

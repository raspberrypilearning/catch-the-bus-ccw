Which of these scripts uses a **loop** to make the dog run?

- (x) 
```blocks3
when flag clicked
repeat (5)
move (5) steps
next costume
```

  --- feedback ---

Yes! The `repeat`{:class="block3control"} code block uses a loop to make the dog run.

```blocks3

move (5) steps
```

  --- feedback ---

This code makes the dog move, but only once. There is no loop here, so the code does not repeat.

This code makes the dog run, but it does not use a loop. Using a loop can often make your code shorter.

next costume
move (5) steps
```

There is no loop here, so the dog would only move once. To make the dog run, you would have to add a loop.
